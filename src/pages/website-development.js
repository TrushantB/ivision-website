                                            Ecommerce, also known as electronic commerce or internet commerce, 
                                            refers to the buying and selling of goods or services using the 
                                            internet
                                        </p>

                                            Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a 
                                            site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.

                                            Email templates allow you to customize the formatting and text of 
                                            emails sent by users who share your content. Templates can be 
                                            text-only, or HTML and text, in which case the userâ€™s email client 
                                            will determine which is displayed.
